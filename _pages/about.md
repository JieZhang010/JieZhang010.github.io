# Welcome <img align=center src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26017543/213809353-c908d93c-3dff-4694-9d13-e0e5cbdb879c.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="36" height="36" />

Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I‚Äôm **Jie Zhang (Âº†Êù∞)**, an Associate Professor with the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) under the supervision of Prof. [Shiguang Shan](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~sgshan) in 2017. During my PhD study, I also worked closely with [Meina Kan](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~mnkan). My research interests cover computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, particularly include face recognition, image segmentation, weakly/semi-supervised learning, domain generalization. I have published more than 20 papers in refereed journals and proceedings in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition, such as CVPR, ICCV and ECCV. I have also won several awards, namely, Runner-up Award in IEEE FG Identity-preserved Human Detection Challenge 2020,Championship Award in ACM MM Kinship Recognition Challenge 2017, Runner-up Award in IEEE CVPR Landmark Detection Challenge 2017, Runner-up Award in IEEE ICCV Apparent Age Estimation Challenge 2015, etc. 


**<font color="blue">Internship and Graduate Students Opening</font>**: I am looking for self-motivated candidates who have solid mathematical backgrounds, strong English ability, and strong coding skills. If you are interested in doing research on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, please send detailed CV to me.
