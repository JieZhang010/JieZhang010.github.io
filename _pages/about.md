# Welcome <img align=center src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26017543/213809353-c908d93c-3dff-4694-9d13-e0e5cbdb879c.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="36" height="36" />

Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I‚Äôm **Jie Zhang (Âº†Êù∞)**, an Associate Professor with the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) under the supervision of Prof. [Shiguang Shan](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~sgshan) and Prof. [Xilin Chen](https://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/xlchen/).  I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with  [Meina Kan](http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/people/~mnkan) (Professor at CAS). My research interests cover computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, particularly include adversarial attacks and defenses,  domain generalization, AI safety and trustworthiness. I have published more than 40 papers in refereed journals and proceedings in the areas of computer vision and machine learning, such as TPAMI, IJCV, TIP, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV and ECCV. I am successively selected for the Beijing Nova Program, the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the MSRA "Casting Star Project". I have also won several awards, namely, Runner-up Award in IEEE FG Identity-preserved Human Detection Challenge 2020,Championship Award in ACM MM Kinship Recognition Challenge 2017, Runner-up Award in IEEE CVPR Landmark Detection Challenge 2017, Runner-up Award in IEEE ICCV Apparent Age Estimation Challenge 2015, etc. 


**<font color="blue">Internship and Graduate Students Opening</font>**: I am looking for self-motivated candidates who have solid mathematical backgrounds, strong English ability, and strong coding skills. If you are interested in doing research on Computer Vision and AI Safety, please send detailed CV to me.
